# Project

This project, still in development, is based on the scripts (Python 2) made in the book **neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com** by **Michael Nielsen**, and also on the **Michael Daniel Dobrzanski**'s scripts, that is the same as the book by in Python 3. The aim of this project is to reproduce and evolve what was done by the aforementioned works, achieving better performance and accuracy, and making it a software-product, with user interface and new functionalities.

## Road Map

- Finish the basic neural network

- Improve the accuracy with some other techniques

- Read the digit from a generic photo

- Read a sequence of digits from a generic photo

- Extend to the alphabet

- Build a web or desktop user interface
